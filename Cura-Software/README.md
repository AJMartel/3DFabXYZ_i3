These instructions are for a Windows PC - I do not have a Mac or Linux machine to test on.  For those operating systems check the CURA website for installation instructions.

Take the content of this directory and place it somewhere on your computer - there is no installation required.

Once you have the software copied to a location then make a shortcut from the desktop to the migbot.bat file so
you can start the CURA slicer software directly from the desktop if you wish.
